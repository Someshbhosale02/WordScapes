# WordScapes
console-based simulator of the WordScapes games




In this project, we will create the console-based simulator of the WordScapes games, where the 
user is given some letters and the user has to guess the words from those letters.

This game is designed for only 5 levels. At each level, the user will be given some letters and 
the user has to guess 3 words to move to the next level. If the user guesses the wrong word at any 
chance, the user will lose one live point and will be asked to give another word. The user will 
get 5 lives which means the user can make 5 wrong guesses. After 5 wrong guesses, the game will 
automatically get over and the user will get the final score. But if the user makes the correct 3 
guesses, they will move to the next level. At the end of each level, the user will be asked if the 
user wants to continue or not. If the user selects yes, the game will continue but if the user 
selects no then the game will stop at that level and the final score will be displayed.
